 table_path.py
  For each grid, output the minimum number of encountered on one line, followed by the path taken on the next (indicate paths by printing the sequence of 
  squares visited as denoted by the Kakamora population). When re-constructing path backwards, favor horizontal movements first, then vertical, and finally diagonal 
  as this will maximize the number of regions visited and give consistent path results.
  
  Ex input:
    5
    1 5 2 3 6
    4 3 2 1 2
    3 8 4 2 1
    0 5 2 3 4
    3 1 4 2 1
