BST.py:
Using divide and conquer O(nlogn) runtime
Given a series of lines, where each line contain a sequence of integers in ascending order, output the binary search tree constructed from the sequence of integers by displaying all the nodes in the BST level by level

  Ex input:
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6
  Ex output:
    3
    1 5
    0 2 4 6
    
BFS.py
Given a tree input in breadth-first order, and a decimal target, find the number of occurences the binary target has on the tree
  Ex input:
    3 110010000111111
    9 110010000111111
    2 110010000111111
  Ex output:
    Paths that form 3 in binary (11): 4
    Paths that form 9 in binary (1001): 4
    Paths that form 2 in binary (10): 2
